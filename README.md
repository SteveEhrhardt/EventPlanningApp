# Event Planning App
# Currently this was a simple CRUD app to demonstrate Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting records in this class example of an Event Planning App. Maybe someday I will turn this into something useful but for now it runs as a simple Python Django Application that allows maintenance of 4 vendor tables along with the main Event table.
